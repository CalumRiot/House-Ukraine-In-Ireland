## **User Experience**

### **Project Goals:**
My main goal for this project was to design and create a fully functional blog-like django site. The site would have full CRUD functionality allowing registered users to Create, Read, Update & Delete blog posts and comments made by them. A registered user should have full control over there own posts with a superuser also being present to ensure all posts/comments are being made with good intentions.

### **Planning/Strategy:**
Before beginning my project an Agile methodology was used to plan out my projects intended purpose/features. I done this by creating a project called CalumRiot's PP4 in this I created a product backlog using the principals of Agile to assign each possible feature a User Story and a priority using the MoSCoW prioritisation method. In total I had 6 Must-Haves, 5 Should-Haves, 2 Could-Haves & 3 Won't Haves.
